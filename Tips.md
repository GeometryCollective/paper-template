# Some Tips for Writing Better Papers
### Keenan Crane

Welcome to your career in STEM.  Hope you were paying attention in English class.

Communication is by far the most important skill in STEM.  Yes, you will need great technical ideas.  But you will also need to write papers, write rebuttals for your papers, write reviews, give talks, explain ideas informally in a hallway or restaurant or bar, sit through grueling job interviews, write grant proposals, write letters of recommendation, and so on.  Having brilliant ideas is not enough.  To survive (and thrive), you must be able to write.

Writing, or even _defining_, a "good" technical paper is challenging—see for instance Fredo Durand's, [How to Write a Bad Article](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/FredoBadWriting.pdf).  Plenty of other notes like this one have been writen, such as Fredo's [notes on writing](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/PUBLI/writing.pdf), [Three Sins of Authors in Computer Science and Math](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jrs/sins.html) by Jonathan Shewchuk, and [lots of good stuff](http://pgbovine.net/writing-summary.htm) by Philip Guo.  For writing in general, a great book is, ["On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction"](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548) by William Zinsser.

This document contains some of my own scattered thoughts about writing, targeted mainly for my PhD students.  It is not gospel, and I do not provide any guarantees—just a bunch of things that have worked well for me.  In fact, you will get more mileage out of thinking critically about your own process than blindly following someone else's advice.  The final section, on presentation, has some details that are specific to putting together a good-looking paper in the 2-column ACM format, and may not translate directly to other formats (though hopefully some sentiments carry over).

## Process

### Write every day.

No big surprises here: if you want to get better at _anything_, do it often.  One good way to get consistent writing practice is to keep a research blog or journal where you document your daily activities.  These can be, for instance, specific calculations or experiments, notes about a paper you read, or just a summary of what you worked on that day and what you think the next few steps should be.  A lot of people freeze when they sit down to write, and never hit the "publish" button because they fear they have to write something complete, or something great.  It does not have to be _Ulysses_ and it does not have to be the _Principia_—just something short and informative about what's been going on in your brain lately.  What is important is that:

1. you do it on a regular basis, and
2. you write in complete English sentences

(or sentences in the language of your choice).  You will not improve your writing by slopping together sentence fragments, and you definitely won't get better by sitting down to write only when a deadline rolls around.

### Write non-technical stuff.

To build just a little strength in your daily life, you have to lift heavy weights at the gym; to build endurance, you have to go on long runs at high altitude.

To improve your technical writing, engage in activities that go above and beyond the requirements of your day job.  For instance: write poetry.  Writing a decent poem is (sorry, STEM folks) much harder than writing a decent conference paper.  The shape and sound of every word counts.  Subtle changes in diction have a dramatic impact on meaning.  You have to consider things like meter and rhythm, which you generally ignore in technical writing.  But with enough practice, all this heavy lifting becomes habit, and bleeds into your technical writing.

### Write as a means of problem solving.

Writing is a means of thinking.  If you can't write clearly about an idea, chances are you can't think about it clearly either.

Getting stuck on a problem is a normal part of research.  Brilliant researchers aren't people who can solve every problem under the sun—often they're just people who have mechanical, actionable strategies for moving forward when they get stuck.  One is to _write_.  For instance, suppose you don't know how to move forward with a project.  It can't hurt to fill in one of the following blanks with a complete sentence or two:

* "The problem I'm trying to solve is ______"
* "Just to recap, some basic definitions are ______"
* "The specific argument I'm trying to make is ______"
* "What I know so far about this problem is ______"
* "What I'm confused about is ______"
* "When I performed an experiment, here's exactly what happened: ______"
* "In a previous approach to a similar problem, the authors ______"
* "Even if it doesn't totally answer my question, I guess something I could try next is ______"
* "What this experiment will tell me is ______"

It's amazing how much you can learn by just trying to complete a sentence.  Even just recalling some basic definitions (say) can give you just the "aha!" you need to keep on going.  And even if this activity doesn't take you anywhere, hey, you got some writing practice!

### Read.

Even if you can't write well, you probably have opinions about _other_ people's writing.  You know a bad paper when you see one.  You know when you see a paper you like.  The more you read, the more examples you will have to draw from—of both the good and the bad.  (Note: I do _not_ mean that you should directly plagiarize the good writing!)

Then, turn the microscope on yourself.  The better you get at detecting flaws in others' writing, the better you become at seeing your own.  The more you recognize the strengths of others' arguments, the more you can re-shape your own.
